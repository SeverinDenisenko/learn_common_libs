# Learn Folly (& Boost (& Qt))

In my career as a software engineer, I found nearly impossible to do something
without Folly and Boost libraries. This is ironical, no one in the university or
courses teach how to use them properly. So this is my experiment, trying
to figure out right and wrong ways. I share them so maybe they would be useful
for someone.

## System requarements and dependensies

You have to figure them out and install all libraries by yourself.

## Project structure

* Specific library folders
* * Boost
* * Folly
* * Qt
* Cool examples // TODO
* Intergration examples // TODO
* Learning papers
